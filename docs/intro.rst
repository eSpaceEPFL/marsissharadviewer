General description
===================

*MARSIS/SHARAD viewer* is a plug-in for the QGIS software (http://www.qgis.org/). It's aim is to provide an easy way to visualize radargrams from MARSIS (http://sci.esa.int/mars-express/34826-design/?fbodylongid=1601) and SHARAD (http://mars.nasa.gov/mro/mission/instruments/sharad/) ground penetrating radars.

It is written in Python and uses the PyQtGraph (http://www.pyqtgraph.org/) library for 2D and 3D plots rendering.


The plug-in is made to work together with the MARSIS and SHARAD tracks DB as provided by EPFL-eSpace (see tracks DB documentation for details).


**The development work leading to these results has received funding from the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under iMars grant agreement n° 607379.**
