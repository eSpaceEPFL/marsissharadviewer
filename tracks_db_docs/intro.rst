Introduction
============

This is a short documentation for the use of a database of **geometric data and metadata** of the tracks of the two MARS ground penetrating radars existing so far: MARSIS (http://sci.esa.int/mars-express/34826-design/?fbodylongid=1601) and SHARAD(http://mars.nasa.gov/mro/mission/instruments/sharad/)
The data are available as **vector layers** to be used with **GIS software**.

The database is a result of the contribution of the EPFL Space Engineering Center (http://espace.epfl.ch/) to the iMars grant agreement n°607379 (http://www.i-mars.eu/) of the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013).

The layers are currently available through a direct connection to the PostGIS/PostgreSQL DBMS (http://postgis.net/ http://www.postgresql.org/) implementing the db.
Availability of the layers through WFS (http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs) protocol using MapServer (http://mapserver.org/) is planned but not yet implemented.
